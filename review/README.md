# Review staging

This folder contains files moved out of the repo root during cleanup (old backups, reports, media, and temp artifacts).

- Nothing here is required to run the voice agent.
- Safe to delete after you confirm you don’t need anything.
- If you want to keep any of these long-term, move them into an appropriate home (e.g. `docs/` or `frontend/static/icons/`).
